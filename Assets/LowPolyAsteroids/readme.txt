Hello,
Thank you for purchasing Asteroid Pack.

This is a graphical asset, no animations, so there is not much to tell about it. If you want to use it on iPhone or similar devices, you should just switch the materials to simple diffuse (much faster, and the difference is barely noticeable on small screens). I also added a specular map in case you need it.

Please note that the scene&scripts are just there to show the asteroids. I am an artist, and not a programmer, so my solutions might be primitive in Unity. Use the scripts at your own risk; I do not support them.

If you have any problems or want to share your opinions, you can write to kalamona01@gmail.com.

Cheers,
Gergely Zsolnay
